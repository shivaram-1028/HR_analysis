Let's start simple: If you were describing what it's like working here to a friend, what would you say?\n[I'd tell them it's a frustrating place for an engineer. We're fighting a decade of technical debt with no real mandate or resources from leadership to fix it. The pay is below market rate, and career advancement seems to require leaving the company.]","2. On a scale from 1 (very unhappy) to 5 (very happy), how would you rate your overall job satisfaction?\n[2 - I stay because I like my immediate team, but the broader organizational dysfunction is wearing me down.]",3. What aspects of your work do you find most challenging or concerning?\n[The technical debt is crushing our velocity. We spend 70% of our time maintaining legacy systems instead of building new features. Management doesn't understand the technical implications of their decisions.],"4. What would need to change for you to feel more satisfied and engaged at work?\n[Significant investment in modernizing our tech stack, competitive compensation packages, and leadership that actually listens to engineering concerns rather than just pushing for faster delivery.]","5. Any other thoughts or feedback you'd like to share?\n[I've started looking at other opportunities. Several of my colleagues have already left for better-paying roles with more modern tech stacks. If things don't change soon, you'll lose more senior engineers.]","Comprehensive analysis: This senior engineer represents a significant flight risk. The combination of technical frustration, compensation concerns, and feeling unheard by leadership creates a perfect storm for turnover. Immediate action needed on technical debt reduction and compensation review."

Love the creative challenges and my team, but the resource constraints and changing direction make it hard to execute effectively.]",3. What aspects of your work do you find most challenging or concerning?\n[Budget limitations force us to be constantly reactive rather than strategic. Every quarter there are new priorities that invalidate months of planning. It's exhausting to constantly start over.],"4. What would need to change for you to feel more satisfied and engaged at work?\n[More predictable budgets and strategic direction. When we do get resources, we do amazing work. But the constant fire-drilling kills morale and wastes potential.]","5. Any other thoughts or feedback you'd like to share?\n[The marketing team has incredible potential but we're hamstrung by organizational chaos above us. With better planning and resource allocation, we could be a real competitive advantage.]",Analysis: Strong team dynamics and creative satisfaction but frustrated by resource constraints and strategic instability.

We're like human shields for the company's technical and product issues. There's no career progression path, and the pay doesn't reflect the emotional labor required.]",4. What would need to change for you to feel more satisfied and engaged at work?\n[Fix the underlying product issues we field complaints about. Create advancement opportunities beyond 'senior support rep.' Recognize that this role requires significant emotional labor and compensate accordingly.],"5. Any other thoughts or feedback you'd like to share?\n[Customer support should have a voice in product development since we see all the pain points firsthand. Instead, we're treated like a cost center rather than a valuable source of customer insights.]",Analysis: Clear burnout indicators with feeling undervalued and trapped. The disconnect between frontline customer experience and product development creates systemic frustration. Risk of turnover unless role is restructured with growth path and better integration with product teams.

But the broader organization doesn't seem to value user-centered design principles, which makes it hard to feel like we're making a real impact.]",Analysis: Mixed satisfaction with strong team dynamics but systemic frustration with organizational priorities. The tension between design best practices and business pressures creates ongoing stress. Potential to improve with better integration of UX in strategic planning.

Let's start simple: If you were describing what it's like working here to a friend, what would you say?\n[It's a great place if you value autonomy and work-life balance.

On a scale from 1 (very unhappy) to 5 (very happy), how would you rate your overall job satisfaction?\n[3 - I love the strategic work and the impact, but the operational chaos and competing demands are wearing me down.]","3. What aspects of your work do you find most challenging or concerning?\n[Every stakeholder thinks their priority should be #1.

With better organizational support and clearer decision-making frameworks, this could be an amazing role.]",Analysis: High potential role with significant impact but suffering from organizational dysfunction and competing priorities without clear frameworks.

Right now it feels like the company sees facilities as a necessary evil rather than a valuable service.]",Analysis: Clear undervaluation and invisibility issues creating significant dissatisfaction.

Let's start simple: If you were describing what it's like working here to a friend, what would you say?\n[It's an amazing learning opportunity with incredibly smart people, but the codebase is so complex that it takes forever to understand how to contribute meaningfully.]","2. On a scale from 1 (very unhappy) to 5 (very happy), how would you rate your overall job satisfaction?\n[2.5 - Love the learning environment and my teammates, but feeling overwhelmed and unproductive most of the time.]","3. What aspects of your work do you find most challenging or concerning?\n[The technical debt and complexity make it really hard to understand how things work. I spend days trying to figure out simple changes, and I worry I'm not contributing enough.]","4. What would need to change for you to feel more satisfied and engaged at work?\n[Better documentation, more structured onboarding for the codebase, and maybe a formal mentorship program. I want to contribute but need more support to get there.]","5. Any other thoughts or feedback you'd like to share?\n[Everyone is incredibly patient and helpful when I ask questions, but I feel like I'm asking the same types of questions that better documentation could answer. I want to be productive!]",Analysis: Low-moderate satisfaction with high learning motivation but systematic barriers to productivity. The technical debt impacts new developer experience significantly. Better onboarding and documentation could improve satisfaction and productivity.
